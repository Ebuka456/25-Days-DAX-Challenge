## What is DAX? 
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a powerful formula language used in Microsoft Power BI, Excel, and Analysis Services. It allows you to create calculations, define measures, and perform advanced data manipulation tasks.

## Challenge Details üèÜ
**Duration**: 25 days
**Objective**: Sharpen DAX skills and explore its capabilities
**Focus Areas**: Calculation formulas, measures, advanced functions, data modeling, and optimization techniques

## Repository Structure üéõÔ∏è
This repository is organized into 25 folders, one for each day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you will find the following:

**DAX Solution Files** : These files contain my DAX solutions for the specific challenge of that day.
**README.md**: This document provides an explanation of the challenge and my approach to solving it.

### How to Use
To explore my solutions, navigate to the respective day's folder and access the DAX solution file. You can open the file in Microsoft Power BI to review the formulas and calculations.

Feel free to examine and study the solutions to enhance your understanding of DAX concepts and techniques. You can also modify the solutions and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your DAX skills.

### Contributions
I am excited to contribute to this challenge by sharing my solutions and engaging with fellow participants. I encourage you to collaborate, discuss, and provide feedback on the solutions and approaches. Together, we can expand our knowledge and master the art of DAX.

### Let's Get Started! üéñÔ∏è
